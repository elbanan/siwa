# Optional: Mount an external data directory that users can access from within the app.
# Step-by-step:
#   1. Pick or create a folder on your machine (for example, `/Users/yourusername/data`).
#   2. Uncomment and set `EXTERNAL_DATA_PATH` below to that path.
#   3. When running locally, keep the API's `SIWA_HOME` (in `apps/siwa-api/.env`) pointed at the
#      same directory so both services read/write the same files.
#   4. When packaging with Docker, use the same host folder in `apps/siwa-api/.env.docker` and bind
#      it into the container (e.g. `docker-compose.yml` volume `${EXTERNAL_DATA_PATH:-./data}:/siwa/data`).
#      This keeps the host folder accessible even after the containers restart.

# EXTERNAL_DATA_PATH=/Users/yourusername/your-data-folder
